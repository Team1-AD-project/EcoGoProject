Singapore has a world-class public transit system (MRT + bus covering the entire island), and the cycling path network is continuously expanding. The government aims for 80% of households to be within a 10-minute walk of an MRT station by 2030.\n"}
{"chunk_id": "green_travel_faq_1", "source": "docs:green_travel_faq", "title": "Green Travel FAQ", "text": "**Q: How do I calculate my carbon footprint?**\nA: EcoGo automatically detects your transport mode and calculates emissions. Rough guide: Private car ~175g CO2/km, MRT ~35g CO2/km, walking/cycling = 0. Your carbon reduction = Private car emissions - Your actual transport emissions.\n\n**Q: How do I earn EcoGo green points?**\nA: Points are automatically awarded after each green trip (walking, cycling, bus, carpool) based on your carbon reduction. Every 100g CO2 reduced = 1 point.\n\n**Q: What can I do with green points?**\nA: Redeem points in the EcoGo store for vouchers, products, and VIP membership. You can also compete on the leaderboard for more rewards.\n\n**Q: How to travel green on rainy days?**\nA: Singapore's MRT stations are connected by covered walkways — take the MRT + walk through sheltered corridors to your destination. Public buses are also a great option. Always carry a folding umbrella.\n\n**Q: How to travel green within NUS campus?**\nA: NUS has free Internal Shuttle Buses (ISB) — take routes A1/A2/D1/D2/K. Walking is also great for short campus trips; most major buildings are within 15 minutes of each other on foot.\n"}
